# Processing_TicTacToe_Game
Tic Tac Toe game written in processing

Hi, I am new to github and this is the first thing I share in the github. It is a Tic Tac Toe game written in [processing](https://processing.org/). It is one player game. There are three difficulty levels as below:
* Easy: the computer will make random move.
* Normal: the computer will make random move but it will block the opponent if he/she has two in a row
* Impossible: the computer will play based on Strategy in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy).

There are 4 buttons, 2 buttons in the bottom left side to start and end game. And 2 buttons in the bottom right side, one of them is to select the difficulty and the other one is to choose the player letter (X or O).

For flowchart, I use [yEd Graph Editor](http://www.yworks.com/products/yed)

Thanks.
