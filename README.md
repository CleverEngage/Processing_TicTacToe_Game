# Processing_TicTacToe_Game
Tic Tac Toe game written in processing

Hi, I am new to github and this it the first thing I share. It is a Tic Tac Toe game written in [processing](https://processing.org/). It is one player game. There are three difficulty levels as below:
* Easy: the computer will make random move.
* Normal: the computer will make random move but it will block the opponent if he/she has two in a row
* Impossible: the computer will play based on Strategy in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy).

There are 4 buttons, 2 buttons in left side to start and end game. And 2 buttons in the right side, one of them to select the difficulty and the other is choose the letter X or O.

Thanks.
